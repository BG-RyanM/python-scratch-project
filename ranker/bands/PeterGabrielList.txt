1. - Melt - Groundbreaking.  Unlike anything that came out before or since.
2. - Security - Fantastic follow-up.  San Jacinto live is mesmerizing.
3.  - Us - Fully matured.  Don't mind Steam one bit.
4. - So - Great album, but as Joe said, too much 80s, overplayed.  Still love Sledgehammer!
5 - Scratch - New to me but digging this. Going to be listening a lot.

6. Us
5. 4 (Security) - he plays safe here...it came as fourth release and had nothing really new.
4. So - it is his most successful and it is easy to see why...it is no bad album but not as thrilling as his earlier stuff.
3. 3 (Melt) - The third of his really great ones, from then on he played it safe and went mainstream to please the crowds...
2. 2 (Scratch) - remember that this came out in 1978 and was light years ahead of anything at the time.
1. 1 (Car) - his most underrated album and by far his most diverse but all the facets work. The album alone justified his departure from his former band. It is the first choice for me whenever I feel like listening to Gabriel.

1. Up - His most mature work of art. Very poetic. Still got some edge. Best tracks: Darkness, Growing Up, Sky Blue, Don't Leave, I Grieve, The Barry Williams Show, My Head Sounds Like That, More Than This, Signal To Noise.
2. So - His greatest commercial success. No duff tracks. Fun. Best tracks: Red Rain, Sledgehammer, Don't Give Up, That Voice Again, In Your Eyes, Mercy Street, Big Time.
3. II (Scratch) - A personal fave. Love the song vibes and textures. Best tracks: On The Air, D.I.Y., Mother Of Violence, A Wonderful Day In A One Day World, White Shadow, Indigo, Flotsam And Jetsam.
4. III (Melt) - Breakthrough album. Found his commercial punch. Best tracks: Intruder, No Self Control, I Don't Remember, Games Without Frontiers, Not One Of Us.
5. IV (Security) - Awesomely ominous. Disturbing. At least half of the album. Best tracks: Rhythm Of The Heat, San Jacinto, I Have The Touch, Shock The Monkey.
6. I (Car) - Very Genesis-like. Lamb Pt.3. A promising solo start. Best tracks: Solsbury Hill, Humdrum, Here Comes The Flood.
7. Us - Sommnabulism sets in. A few uptempo echoes of So. Best tracks: Steam. Digging In The Dirt, Kiss That Frog.
8. Scratch My Back - Liked two remakes: Boy In The Bubble and Listening Wind. Rest too slow and sleepy.
9. New Blood - Orchestra overly slows it all down to a  mellow puddle.
