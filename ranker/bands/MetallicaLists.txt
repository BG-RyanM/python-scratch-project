1. ..And Justice For All - A masterpiece, their best themes, musically and lyrically
2. Ride the Lightning - It is hard to fault this, thin production, but every song is theatrical and meaningful
3. Master of Puppets - a bit sillier lyrically, but the first side is so great, Battery is their best opener.
4. Garage Inc. - One of the best covers albums of all time
5. Reload - The songwriting and the sounds they were playing with are very atmospheric and cool, an obvious Soundgarden influence on this album actually works.
6. Load - Hetfields voice on 'Mama Said' has made me want him to do a country album, and I still want him to do one.
7. Metallica (Black) - it has too many good songs to be any lower even though I agree it does not flow as well as an album.
8. Kill em All - It is fine, but basic thrash and I could swap it out with any number of classic thrash albums.
9. Lulu - basically a Lou Reed album with Metallica just as a backing band, but they stretch themselves to different territory here.
10. St. Anger - other than Lulu, it is their last creative project. I love the sound of this album, it is revolutionary and weird, but the songs have dumb lyrics and go too long, it is OVERHATED for real.
11. Hardwired to Self Destruct - it has some really good moments but needs more hooks and drama. Great sounding record though.
12. 72 Seasons - The songs aren't super distinct and the production is way too PRO TOOLS, everything quantized.
13. Death Magnetic - the start of them regressing as creative musicians trying to give people what they wanted, and it is so dull.

11. St. Anger (2003)-total crap.
10. Death Magnetic (2008)-didn't listen to it until years after it came out and it didn't make an impression on me. Checked it out again last month, and it does nothing for me.
9. Reload (1997)-feels like a bunch of b-sides from Load. Totally sucks.
8. 72 Seasons (2023)- I've only listened to it once. I didn't dislike it but it didn't really grab me. I wanted to like it, and maybe I will more when I get around to listening again.
7. Hardwired To Self Destruct (2016)- I really dug it when it came out, listened to it all the time. Haven't gone back in awhile.
6. Load (1996)- I have a bit of a soft spot cause this tour was my first ever concert in January of 1997!
5. Kill Em All (1983)- for whatever reason I haven't always spent a ton of time with this one. I probably would like it more with more listens. Doubt it'd break into my top four, but maybe!
4. Master Of Puppets (1986)- I know it's considered their best by a lot of people, and maybe it is. I just like the other three I have above it more.
3. And Justice For All (1988)- I'm aware the production is lacking but I don't really care. It's dark, and heavy, and to be this is them in their prime.
2. Black Album (1991)- I'm more of a hard rock guy than a thrash fan, so I just love this one. It came out right when I was getting into rock music.
1. Ride The Lightning (1984)- I like Megadeth WAY more than Metallica, but this album is, to me, the greatest album in that kind of thrash/80s metal genre.
