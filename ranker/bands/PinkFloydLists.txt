# YT 6

15: Endless River - (shameless cash grab - avoid)
14: Ummagumma - (SIDE A: uninspired live tracks SIDE B : unlistenable noodling - avoid)
13: Atom Heart Mother (a couple of decent tracks but far from essential)
12: A Momentary Lapse of Reason (very dated 80s dad rock)
11: Obscured by Clouds (i never seem to remember anything about this)
10: The Division Bell (has its moments but suffers from no Waters input)
9: A Saucerful of Secrets (set the controls and a few other ok things)
8: The Final Cut (sounds like outtakes from the Wall, some of it really hits)
7: More (does a lot More for me than most, very under rated imo)
6: The Wall (floyds white album, a bit bloated but theres a lot of good to great stuff on here)
5: Wish You Were Here (thought it would rank higher, shine on and the title track save it from mediocrity)
4: Meddle (their first top tier record post syd barrett)
3: Piper At the Gates of Dawn (i love the syd era)
2: Animals (took a few listens to fully appreciate and a bit of a downer but its genius concept masterfully pulled off)
1: Dark Side of the Moon - (genuine contender for greatest album of all time)

# YT 8

1) Wish You Were Here - amazing front to back - before Roger took full control
2) Animals - I discovered this one years after their big three
3) Dark Side of the Moon - slips because I hate Money at this point
4) The Wall - amazing but I almost never want to sit and listen to it as a whole
5) A Momentary Lapse of Reason - while the synths are dated they just work for me
6) Meddle - this was the album that started their classic run
7) The Division Bell - the lyrics are poor but the soundscape is great
8) Obscured by Clouds - it grows on me on each listen - I far prefer Meddle but it's a solid album
9) The Final Cut - while it's basically just a poor retread of The Wall I still enjoy it more than the rest of the list
10) Atom Heart Mother - this is the first time I heard what I loved from Floyd
11) More
12) The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
13) A Saucerful of Secrets
14) The Endless River - a waste of time even though I love Gilmour solos
15) Ummagumma - blech

# YT 16

1) Animals (1977). I heard this on release as a 13 year old and it's been my favorite PF album since. Wish You Were Here has vied for that position now and again but the darkness and ugliness around this record has always fascinated me.
2) Wish You Were Here (1975). The title track wasn't as overplayed in Australia as other places it seems. I still love it and the album entire.
3) The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). A masterpiece and Barrett's veneration is fully justified in my opinion.
4) The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). Probably deserves to be higher but this is the one I've heard too much. A groundbreaking masterpiece nonetheless.
5) Meddle (1971). It took me awhile to appreciate this one but Echoes is very special.
6) Obscured by Clouds (1972) I've grown to appreciate this much more over the years and it may rise higher over time.
7) The Final Cut (1983). Always liked this more than The Wall.
8) The Wall (1979). Brilliantly executed album but so up and down with many terrible songs.
9) Atom Heart Mother (1970). A sentimental favorite which doesn't hold up so well these days. This was the very first vinyl LP I bought with my own money.
10) More (1969). I like this one a lot more than most.I really like Cirrus Minor and Cymbaline which contradicts my statement about Roger above.
11) A Saucerful of Secrets (1968). Kinda boring and aimless after Piper. I do love Jugband Blues.
12) A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)
13) The Division Bell (1994). Interchangeable but in later years I've probably begun to like D/Bell more Momentary.
14) The Endless River (2014) Boring. Bought it and sold it very quickly. I remember almost nothing about it. Pleasant enough but I did feel cheated.
15) Ummagumma (1969). Yep pretty awful, only the live record saves it from the bin.

1) Animals (Masterpiece, as all first 4 in my list (Pigs On The Wing unedited version is genious!)
2) The Final Cut (Totally underrated, check the sadly 7" only full lenght of "The Hero's Return" WHY left off???)
3) Meddle ("Seamus" and "San Tropez" is highly forgettable after 10 or so spins, the rest amazing)
4) Wish You Were Here (Check out the original intended version, flows very well)
5) Saucerful of Secrets MONO (Add the 68 singles and Syd 1968 sessions!!!!)
6) The Piper at the Gates of Dawn MONO (Plus all Syd 7")
7) Atom Heart Mother (Love all except "If" which could be replaced with the Relics outtake "Biding My Time")
8) Dark Side of the Moon (overplayed, a true classic though, worth hearing Alan Parsons Mix and the few outtakes)
9) Obscured by Clouds (so incredible underrated, i cant believe it)
10) Ummagumma (Great Live album, intresting Studio Solo album, strange sequenced though)
11) More (Highly under-rated, two or three fillers though)
12) The Wall (over-rated but very good, (as a one disc : i`d keep Bring The Boys/Vera over C Numb (YUP!)
13) The Endless River (a fitting farewell album in every way, but combine 2/5, remove 2/5 Division and its superb)
14) The Division Bell (If they only worked a little more on this project)
15) A Momentary Lapse of Reason (as About Face/Zee/Radio Kaos : forgettable, all things 1985-1991 is BAD)

15. endless river
14. ummagumma (studio)   -- there are good moments. dave gilmour's narrow way  and roger water's  tracks
13.  more   -- cymbaline, green is the colour, cirrus minor, the nile song
12. a momentary lapse of reason -- one slip, learning to fly, and sorrow... too bad there is alot of filler
11. atom heart mother  -- cant stand geesin's work with title track. alan's psychedelic breakfast is awful . rest is good
10.  the division bell  -- take it back, keep talking, wearing the inside out..... really decent album actually
9. the final cut   -- very underrated.   only sleeper song is the final track, two suns at sunset
8. a saucerful of secrets   -- let there be more light, the title track, corporal clegg. great stuff
7. meddle   ---  fave track on this album, echoes... but too bad the worst one is also on there, seamus.
6. the wall --  i prefer the live versions  with "what shall we do now" and "the last few bricks"
5. obscured by clouds--  very underrated album. so many good tracks.  one of nick's faves
4. wish you were here -- shine on you crazy diamond (all 9 parts)
3. animals --- dogs and sheep alone
2. piper at the gates of dawn -- astronomy domine, flaming, interstellar overdrive, pure  psychedelia....
1. dark side of the moon  -- i know, very cliche, but it is the best. hands down. nothing flows like this album.....
